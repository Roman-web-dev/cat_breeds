    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Aegean cat is one of the oldest natural domestic cat breeds. 
        Originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece, this breed developed without human input. 
        Aegean cats are medium-sized with medium hair length. They are known for their friendly,
        sociable, and intelligent nature. Over the millennia, they have developed a fondness for 
        humans. In Greece and the surrounding islands, they are valued for their rodent catching 
        skills. Aegean cats are notably chatty – they have a tendency to enjoy long conversations 
        with their people. These cats have a natural fondness for water.</p>
